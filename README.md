To modify your Python script so that it generates a complete `README.md` file that includes both the introductory text and the dynamically generated dashboard table, you can follow the steps below. The script will read the existing content, append the generated table, and then save it all into the `README.md` file.

### Updated Python Script

Hereâ€™s how you can modify your existing script:

```python
import os
import json

def generate_dashboard_table(dash_folder):
    table_rows = []
    table_header = "| Name | Owner | Link | Github | ðŸ†“Free / ðŸ’µPaid | Docs |\n"
    table_header += "|------|-------|------|--------|-------------|-----------|\n"

    # Iterate through each folder in the Dash directory
    for dashboard in os.listdir(dash_folder):
        dashboard_path = os.path.join(dash_folder, dashboard)
        
        # Check if it's a directory
        if os.path.isdir(dashboard_path):
            detail_file = os.path.join(dashboard_path, 'detail.json')
            
            # Check if detail.json exists
            if os.path.isfile(detail_file):
                with open(detail_file, 'r') as f:
                    details = json.load(f)
                    # Create a table row
                    row = f"| {dashboard} | {details['owner']} | {details['link']} | {details['github']} | {details['pricing']} | [Docs]({details['docs']}) |"
                    table_rows.append(row)

    # Combine header and rows
    full_table = table_header + "\n".join(table_rows)
    return full_table

if __name__ == "__main__":
    dash_folder = 'Dash'  # Change this if your folder is named differently
    table = generate_dashboard_table(dash_folder)
    
    # Prepare the full README content
    readme_content = f"""# Pterodactyl-Dashboard-List
